# ATACseq_Epigenetic_Markers
We studied T-cell responses to the first SARS-CoV2 vaccine in immunocompromised and healthy groups, finding variability in responses. We isolated and sequenced naive CD4 and CD8 T-cells from 5 individuals to identify pre-vaccination epigenetic markers that predict response strength.
